### Running

This app requires a valid osu! API key to function. Set the API key in an environment variable named `OSU_API_KEY`
in the shell where you run the app.

Aside from that, normal Rails/JS app operations:
- `bundle install`
- `rails db:create` and `rals db:migrate`
- `yarn install`
- `rail s`

Under heavy rewrite at the moment, better docs later :pepega:
